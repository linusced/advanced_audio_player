# Advanced Audio Player
A program for advanced playback of audio files which allows mixing / creating transitions between audio files by keyframing the amplitude, low-pass-filter and high-pass-filter of each individual audio track.
I'm using some of my own libraries for this project. These are [lc_gui](https://github.com/linusced/lc_gui), [lc_audio](https://github.com/linusced/lc_audio) and [lc_utility](https://github.com/linusced/lc_utility).
